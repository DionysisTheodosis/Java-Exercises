  - __Description__: Build a Swing application to manage hotel reservetions, and store the objects in a file
- ## Second Exercise [(DSPROJECT01icsd15066)](https://github.com/DionysisTheodosis/Java-Exercises/tree/master/%CE%9A%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1/DSPROGECT01icsd15066):
  - __Description__: Build a Tcp Client-Server project that allows clients to use a Java Swing GUI interface to create, save, delete, and modify text files stored on the server.
- ## Third Exercise [(DSPROJECT02icsd15066)](https://github.com/DionysisTheodosis/Java-Exercises/tree/master/%CE%9A%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B5%CE%BC%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1/DSPROGECT02icsd15066):
  - __Description__: The third exercise involves building an airflight booking application. It will feature a Client-Server connection using RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and a Server-Server connection using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Clients will use a Swing GUI to display and book flights, communicating with the server via RMI. The server will further communicate with another server using TCP. The second server will perform queries in a database to support flight booking functionality.
